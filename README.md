# Weather-Dashboard-App

## Description
In this assignment we were tasked with making a fully functional Weather Dashboard Application. We had to use skills in HTML, CSS, and most importantly JavaScript. With HTML I was able to set up a very basic layout for the page, that helped me decide where I wanted things to go and how I wanted my application to look. Using CSS I was able to make my application look neat, pretty, and professional. The buttons have a hover feature, all clickable elements have a pointer cursor, divs have borders to separate the 5 day forecast days, the font is consistent and nice. I took a simple approach with the color scheme and though the white and black looked very nice together, but the search history buttons are a different color to give the application a little pop. Finally, using JavaScript I was able to make fetch requests to the API to get the data needed for the Current and Five Day Forecasts. Also, using JavaScript traversed the data recieved from the API to pull the data I need for my application. JavaScript was used to make the application fully functional, I had to create functions, for loops, and also used JavaScript to append the data to the page. I also used JavaScript to help with styling, I created HTML elements dynamically, added classes to those elements and was able to achieve the results I was looking for. It was a challenging assignment but in the end it fully functional and looks great.
